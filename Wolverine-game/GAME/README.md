A 2D Game 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description :
    This Game was developed using melonJS and the game environment used was created using Tiled Software.
    It is a simple and endless adventure game with enemy characters added.
    This is fully customisable and it can be used to create a new game different from the theme I have used.


Features :
- video autoscaling
- mobile optimized HTML/CSS
- swiping disabled on iOS devices
- debug Panel (if #debug)
- distribution build


## To run 

- Clone the git file.
- Use Xampp or Wamp to run the index.html in a localhost.

Note that you may have to edit the file `Gruntfile.js` if you need to better dictate the order your files load in. Note how by default the game.js and resources.js are specified in a specific order.
